| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **yoawlaki@gmail.com**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. Provide regular updates on our progress
3. Credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Security Considerations for Consciousness Research

This project deals with mathematical modeling of consciousness and philosophical concepts. While the code itself is focused on data analysis and visualization, we recognize that:

- The research could have implications for AI ethics and consciousness studies
- Mathematical models could be misinterpreted or misused
- The philosophical frameworks could be controversial in certain contexts

We encourage responsible use and citation of this work in academic and research contexts.

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Follow secure coding practices
- Use type hints and input validation
- Avoid hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use virtual environments for development

### For Users

- Keep your installation up to date
- Use virtual environments when running the code
- Be cautious when running code with custom parameters
- Report any suspicious behavior or unexpected results

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the security researchers and community members who help keep this project secure through responsible disclosure.
